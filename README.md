# Modified Microcosm Starter

Check the [quickstart guide](http://code.viget.com/microcosm/guides/quickstart.html) to get started.

## Node and NPM

It is recommended that you use [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) to install and manage [Node](http://nodejs.org/) versions. All versions of Node should have [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed by default.

To install NVM, see installation instructions in the [NVM Github Repository](https://github.com/creationix/nvm).


## Setup

```
nvm install
npm install
npm run start
```
